[ProtTrans](https://github.com/agemagician/ProtTrans/) is providing **state of the art pre-trained models for proteins**. ProtTrans was trained on **thousands of GPUs from Summit** and **hundreds of Google TPUs** using various **Transformers Models**.

Have a look at our paper [ProtTrans: cracking the language of life’s code through self-supervised deep learning and high performance computing](https://arxiv.com/) for more information about our work.

This repository will be updated regulary with **new pre-trained models for proteins** as part of supporting **bioinformatics** community in general, and **Covid-19 research** specifically through our [Accelerate SARS-CoV-2 research with transfer learning using pre-trained language modeling models](https://covid19-hpc-consortium.org/projects/5ed56e51a21132007ebf57bf) project.

## 📫&nbsp; Have a question?

We are happy to hear your question in our issues page [ProtTrans](https://github.com/agemagician/ProtTrans/issues)! Obviously if you have a private question or want to cooperate with us, you can always **reach out to us directly** via our [RostLab email](mailto:assistant@rostlab.org?subject=[GitHub]ProtTrans) 

<a name="bug"></a>
## 🤝&nbsp; Found a bug?

Feel free to **file a new issue** with a respective title and description on the the [ProtTrans](https://github.com/agemagician/ProtTrans/issues) repository. If you already found a solution to your problem, **we would love to review your pull request**!.

<a name="requirements"></a>
## ✅&nbsp; Requirements

For protein feature extraction or fine-tuninng our pre-trained models, [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library from huggingface is needed. For model visualization, you need to install [BertViz](https://github.com/jessevig/bertviz) library.
